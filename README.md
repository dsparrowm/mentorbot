# Creating a Simple Technical Mentor bot in Your Terminal with OpenAIâ€™s API
## Description
Using the open ai api, I created a technical mentor bot for students might be interested in utilising the power chatGpt to boost their learning.
The bot serves as a personal technical mentor for the student and has been prompted so.

# Requirements
python installed - any stable version is ok

# Installations
This code has been tested on python 3.8.10
pip3 install openai

# Setting up OpenAI API
To get started, first, you need to create an account on OpenAI. Hereâ€™s how you do it:
1. Visit the OpenAI platformâ€™s https://platform.openai.com/
2. Create an account by providing the necessary details.
3. Once youâ€™ve signed up, navigate to your profile on the top right side of the platform.
4. Click on â€˜View API keysâ€™ from the drop-down menu.
5. Generate a new secret API key by clicking on â€˜Create new secret keyâ€™.
6. Store the generated API key safely in a notepad file ðŸ˜‚, as youâ€™ll need it later.

# Usage
1. clone this repository
2. Navigate to the directory (cd mentorbot)
3. replace the value of openai.api_key with your api key (use a virtual environment for safety)
4. Safe the file and run "python3 mentor.py" on the terminal
5. type quit to end the chat when you are done.
